# PyFunctionDefs
Basic use of Function Definitions in Python 3.

Allows user to run a program and put in input for user.
Let user analyze the use of input taken in as string type
that has to be converted to int type, for these conditions of 
the programs that have been committed as of 10/29/2018. 

Functions in Python have to return a value of some sort, as well
as take in an argument or parameter of some sorts that checks 
certain condition through a series of if statements that determine
if the condition in question is true or false, which is a boolean 
statement that is returned to the user. In addition, return 
statements could also be used to give the user output of a different
type; in this case other than of boolean (true/false) type, the other
return type in use from functions is int type, where an integer 
(whole number) is returned to the user as output.
